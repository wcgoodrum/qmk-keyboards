this is my third mech board and my first handwired/40% board.
- switches: Gateron clicky blues (because i love my first board with cherry blues so much. the click is too fun)
- keycaps: cannabalized from my first two boards: the beloved Leopold FC980m and some cheap chinese 65%
- case: polycarbonate designed and assembled by me using plastic glue, cut by [HypeKeyboards](https://hypekeyboards.ca/)
- plate: designed by me using [KLE](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com) and [ai03](https://kbplate.ai03.com/), cut by [HypeKeyboards](https://hypekeyboards.ca/)
- microcontroller: Stampy by Keebio
- firmware: written by me using QMK

This has been a massive learning experience, definitely will use this knowledge to try again some time and make an even better version of this board. 
I will probably not go with a polycarbonate case next time, as the sound is kind of echoey and it was really hard keeping the pieces perfectly aligned when gluing it together.
I plan to use a laser cutter to cut sheets of plywood to make the case next time, and maybe try a gasket mount to go the extra mile.
I had grander plans for the keymap but I was getting impatient by the end of the process so I just went with a simple vanilla layers one.
